# The “Flower Power” Component Style Guide

<img src="images/flower.png" alt="The fully rendered Flower component" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px">

This style guide describes a single example Design Component, “flower”. Using kss-node, it is auto-generated from comments in the source stylesheets (Sass, in this case).

Style guides like this should be used to aid front-end development of a website or app. They can aid in:

* Documentation of the CSS classes needed to style the project.
* Testing of the CSS using a Continuous Integration process and a testing framework.
* Focusing the front-end developer so they can visualize a design component as it is implemented.
* Debugging an already-implemented project.

### Installation

Installation instructions for automatically building this style guide can be found in [README.md](README.md)
