# The “Flower Power” Component Style Guide

<img src="images/flower.png" alt="The fully rendered Flower component" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px">

Design components are en emerging standard on how to build web sites and apps. By thinking about full “page” designs as a collage of independent design “components”, we can build leaner and more maintanable CSS. **The “flower” component is a visual metaphor to more easily explain how to build a design component.**

Using [kss-node](https://github.com/hughsk/kss-node), the style guide for the flower component is auto-generated from comments in the source stylesheets (Sass, in this case).

Style guides like this should be used to aid front-end development of a website or app. They can aid in:

* Documentation of the CSS classes needed to style the project.
* Testing of the CSS using a Continuous Integration process and a testing framework.
* Focusing the front-end developer so they can visualize a design component as it is implemented.
* Debugging an already-implemented project.

## Video Presentation

The flower component is a main example used in the presentation, “Managing Complex Projects Using Design Components”. The full video of the presentation is available from the Drupalcon 2014 website.
